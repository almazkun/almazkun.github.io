## Schedule an exam
AWS has a special service for all certificate related activities.

- Navigate to https://www.aws.training/certification. Sign in with your [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com) account (not AWS) or create a new one. Be sure to use your real first and last names as in your passport or other ID's 
- After Click the `GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT LINK` and you will be redirected to the AWS training and certification center.
- Click `Schedule New Exam`. 
- Find `AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner` in the table `Eligible Exams`. 
- Choose exam center provider. There are columns with `Schedule with PSI` and `Schedule with Pearson VUE`. These are AWS partners and they provide locations to take an exam. There is no real difference between them, but for a available locations and dates in your area. Choose the one with the best location and available dates. 

        You can check locations here:
        - PSI testing centers: https://awsavailability.psiexams.com/
        - Pearson VUE testing centers: https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/find/testcenter/AWS

- Click on `Schedule with PSI` or `Schedule with Pearson VUE` in `AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner` row.
- You will be redirected to the partner's page. Here you will need to choose the exam, language, select the location, find an available date, and pay. It is possible to take this exam online, but it is not recommended, because, it is the only exam which has this option and the main purpose of taking this exam is to familiarize yourself with the exam center and the process, to feel yourself confident on the next exam. 
- After completing the payment you will receive a confirmation letter and will be asked to check your first and last names again.

## Exam preparation sources

In reading about this AWS CCP, the exam, and reviews, I've concluded that a week of deliberate preparation will be enough to pass. They say, if you are completely new to the cloud computing thing, a month of preparation is enough. 

I had two main sources for preparation:

- The [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co/)'s 4 hrs [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Training 2020 - Full Course](https://youtu.be/3hLmDS179YE) video lesson. On the exam I haven't encountered any question, which had not been covered in this video.
- This [Janeice & Jeanneâ€™s Study Guide](https://www.selikoff.net/2019/01/20/how-i-recommend-studying-for-the-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-exam/). Namely this [AWS Practitioner Study Guide](https://www.selikoff.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AWS-Practioner-Study-Guide.pdf) PDF. It is a list of all services with definitions you need to know.

# 
## Study plan
I had 7 days. 

I've started with scheduling for the exam because I wanted to stay focused and motivated. I knew that I wouldn't be able to study 10 hours a day for 7 days. With work, kids, and life. I had 2 hours the most for the preparation each day. 

- Days 1-4: Although the [Training Video](https://youtu.be/3hLmDS179YE) is 4 hours long it took me 4 days to go over it.

    * Watch the [Training Video](https://youtu.be/3hLmDS179YE) every day for 2 hours. 
    * Write down every `AWS word` (or name of the AWS Service) and give it a meaningful explanation.
    * Complete every walk-though.

- Day 5: Finding the gaps.

    * Gone over the [AWS Practitioner Study Guide](https://www.selikoff.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AWS-Practioner-Study-Guide.pdf) and find things you don't know or don't understand. 
    * Use the left side of the list and define (give an explanation) each of the services yourself. 

- Day 6: Fresh up the memory.
    * Go over the [Training Video](https://youtu.be/3hLmDS179YE) again. Particularly sections toward the end of the video. Remember all of the different services with `Cloud` and `Connect` in their names. Do not afraid to skip sections and going back and forth. 
    * Basically learn all the pricing information, what these services do, and why and how to migrate to the AWS cloud. You don't need to know technical details of implementations or something like that, rather what kind of benefits AWS services bring you or to the company. 
    * Take a free test on [WIZLABS](https://www.whizlabs.com/learn/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-tests).
    * Answer this [AWS Official Sample Exam Questions](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Sample-Questions.pdf).

## The exam

    * Examination room is a room with rows of computer desks, like office cubicles.
    * Go to the assigned computer.
    * You will be provided with paper and pencil.
    * Take an exam, before the final submission, you will have a chance to go over the questions and change the answer, if you want. 
    * They will tell you right away if you `passed` or `failed`.
